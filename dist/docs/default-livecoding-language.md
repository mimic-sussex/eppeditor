# Default Live Coding Language

The code examples below work for *one* language, the default demo language. To run these commands, paste them in the top window and hit cmd+enter. That will evaluate the line.

# Audio Outputs

To route a signal to the outputs on your soundcard, there are the following options:

### The ```>``` operator

Route a single signal to all outputs, by putting an ```>``` at the point in the signal chain where you want to output e.g.

```
>{50}saw;
```

```
{>{{50}saw, {51}saw}add, 500,3}hpz;
```
In the above example, the soundcard will monitor the saw waves, but not the hpz.


To route a single signal to a single channel, using an asterisk and a channel number.

```
>0 {40}sqr;
>1 {40.4}sqr;
```


### dac

To change channel numbers programmatically, use the `dac` function.

```
//alternate noise between left and right channels
{{1}noiz,{{{0.1}pha,10}mul}sqr}dac;
```

# Audio Input
Arguments:
1. Amplitude

```
//wear headphones!
>{1}adc;
```

```
//inevitable Dalek effect
>{{1}adc, {200}sin}mul;
```

# Oscillators

first argument is always the frequency, the last argument the phase.

### sin

Sine wave

```
>{500}sin;
```
```
>{500,0.2}sin;
```

### saw

Saw wave

```
>{500}saw;
```

## tri

Triangle wave

```
>{500}tri;
```

### pha

Phasor (a ramp that rises from 0 to 1)

```
>{500}pha;
```
### ph2

Phasor with start and end phase

```
>{500,0.3,0.8}ph2;
```

### sqr

Square wave

```
>{500}sqr;
```

### pul

Pulse (the second argument is pulsewidth)

```
>{500,0.7}pul;
```
### imp

Impulse (single impulse, useful for triggering)

```
>{2}imp;
```
```
`>{2,0.2}imp;
```

### sawn

Anti-aliased saw wave

```
>{500}sawn;
```

# noiz

White noise

the argument is the amplitude

```
>{0.8}noiz;
```

# Control

### sah

Sample and hold

Arguments:
1. Input signal
2. Sampling period length (milliseconds)

```
:frequency:{{0.1}pha,40,1000}uexp;
>{{:frequency:,500}sah}saw;
```

# Envelopes

### env

The envelope is an adsr envelope, so the arguments are "input signal", attack (in ms), decay (in ms), sustain level (0-1), release (in ms). So here with a square wave as input:

```
>{{1}sqr,10,200,0.05,200}env;
```

multiplied with a sine wave:

```
>{{500}sin,{{1}sqr,10,200,0.05,200}env}mul;
```

With a pulse wave as trigger:

```
>{{500}sin,{{1,0.8}pul,10,200,0.05,200}env}mul;
```

Note that the pulse starts at -1, so higher pulse widths give shorter envelopes (gate is open shorter), and they start after the low level of the pulse. You can solve this by multiplying the pulse with -1.

```
>{{500}sin,{{{1,0.8}pul,-1}mul,10,200,0.05,200}env}mul;
```

### line

Triggered line generator

Arguments:
1. Trigger
2. Time (ms) to rise from 0 to 1

```
:line:{{1}clt, 100}line;
>{{1}noiz, :line:}mul;
```

# Sample playback

### The ```\```operator

Samples are preloaded when the audio engine starts up. A list of samples can be found in https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/tree/master/assets/samples

Play a sample once with a trigger, using ```\``` followed by the sample name.

Arguments:
1. A trigger (positive zero crossing)
2. Speed (1=normal, 2=double etc)
3. Offset

Play once:

```
>{1}\909open;
```


Repeat:
```
>{{1}imp}\909open;
```

With some rhythm:

```
>{{{1}sqr,{5}saw}add}\909open;
```

Changing speed:

```
:speed:{{0.01}pha,3}mul;
>{{1}imp, :speed:}\InsectBee;
```

Playing in reverse:
```
>>{{1}imp, -1, 1}\909;
```

Changing offset:
```
:offset:{0.2}pha;
>{{8}imp, 1, :offset:}\909b;
```

# Sample Slicing


### The ```|``` operator

```
>{{1}imp,0.5}|kernel;
```

This sample player can be used for slicing up breaks etc. When there's a zero crossing in the first parameter, the sample position is set to the second parameter; otherwise the sample just loops.  Put a '|' before the sample name to use this player.

```
>{{2}imp,{{0.3}pha,0.1,0.9}ulin}|kernel;
```

Set the position with a phasor - change the impulse and phasor speeds to vary the patterns.

```
>{{32}imp,{0.1}pha}|kernel;
```

This is kind of like (noisy) timestretching

- `mod` : modulo
- `add` : add
- `mul` : multiply
- `sub` : substract
- `div` : divide
- `pow` : power of

`{{400}sin,{600}sin,{200}sin}sum`


Mix signals: (sum and divide by length)

`{{400}sin,{600}sin,{200}sin}mix`

so similar to:

`{{{400}sin,{600}sin,{200}sin}sum,3}div`


Multiply signals:

`{{400}sin,{600}sin,{200}sin}prod`


# mapping values

- `linexp` : arbitrary exponential map from range between arg 2 and 3, to range between arg 4 and arg 5


# lists

Some functions have lists as arguments, or return lists.  Lists are enclosed in square brackets, and contain signals, separated by commas, e.g.

```
[1,2,3]

[1, {100}saw]

[{}mouseX, {}mouseY]

```

Individual list elements can be accessed with the ```at``` function, with two arguments: a list and an index.

```
{[1,2,3],1}at;
```


# communication to the JS window

### Send data:

10 times per second (argument 1) on channel 0 (argument 2). The third argument is signal to send (in this case the output of `{1}sin`).

In the live code editor:

`{{10}imp,0, {1}sin}toJS`

In the model/js editor:

```
input = (x,channel) => {console.log([x,id])};

```

### Receive data from model:

In the live code editor:

`{{0}fromJS}saw`

to receive data on channel 0

In the model/js editor:

```
output(100,0)
```

Note: to separate the two functions in the model window you use three or more underscores:

```
__________
```
# mouse input

Use `{}mouseX` and `{}mouseY`

e.g. this is an FM synthesis with mouse control
```
:freq:{{}mouseX,100,1000}uexp;
:freq2:{{}mouseY,1000}mul;
:mod:{{:freq2:}sin,100}mul;
>{{:freq:,:mod:}add}sin;
```
