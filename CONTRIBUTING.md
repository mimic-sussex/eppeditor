### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Sema. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [debugging guide](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/wiki/3.-How-can-I-debug-Sema%3F).** You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of Sema. This will always be on the [develop branch](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/tree/develop).

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is:issue+user:mimic-sussex)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#atom-and-packages) your bug is related to, create an issue on the repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

##### Description

<!-- Description of the issue -->

##### Steps to Reproduce

For example, start by explaining how you started Sema, e.g. which command exactly you used in the playground or tutorial. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Sema command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Sema) or was this always a problem?
