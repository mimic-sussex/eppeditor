# Interface

We are about to go through the top level areas of interaction in Sema.

## Navigation ##

At the top of the screen, you have a set of links which enable you to navigate within Sema.
* **Playground** – explore live coding languages and machine learning in free-form ways
* **Tutorial** – this screen, the tutorial!
* **Reference** - reference documentation for the default language, API references and useful code snippets. 
* **About** - about page, get to know more about the project.

or, to open external resources in a new tab:
* [**Community**](https://forum.toplap.org/c/communities/sema) – the Sema community on TopLap – come and say hi!

* [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/nNZMJfUHrS) - join the community on Discord.

* [**Github**](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema) – where you can find Sema's repository and contribute to its code base.


## Dashboard ##
The dashboard is the main area of interaction in Sema. By arranging widgets in the grid layout, you can view and interact with the information that matters most.

All widgets share a few common interactions denoted by the following icons:

* **+**  – top-left corner, drags and positions the widget in a grid layout

* **x**  – top-right corner, removes the widget from the dashboard

* **⨼**  – bottom-right corner, resizes the widget

Go ahead and tweak the current layout to your preferences.

## Commands ##

In Sema, there are three kinds of commands accessible through buttons.

The global commands are shared between the *Home*, *Playground* and *Tutorial* areas:

* **Audio** – turn the audio on ([required](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes#webaudio) each time Sema loads) and watch its status

* **SignOut** – sign out of the current user session

The *Playground* provides specific commands for widget creation and playground reset:

* **LiveCode Editor**  – add a liveCode editor, optionally selecting a language from the available

* **JavaScript Editor**  – add a Javascript Editor where you can edit machine learning models. Optionally selecting a model from the available

* **Debuggers**  – add a widget to debug your code and understand what is happening under-the-hood

* **Audio Analyser**  – add an audio analyser to visualise audio

* **Reset**  – clear the playground to start from scratch

Additionally there are commands dependent on the selected widget

* **Grammar Editor**  – add a grammar editor to customize and create new languages (dependent on selected liveCode language).

* **Restart**  – restart you ML model training workflow (ML dependent)

The specific interactions with each widget *type* are covered on the following tutorials.
