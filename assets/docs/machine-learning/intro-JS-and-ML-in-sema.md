# Introduction to the JavaScript Editor and Machine Learning in Sema

The JavaScript Editor allows you to write any JavaScript code you wish. We provide methods to interface with the live-code editor so that you can incorporate the full power of the language of the web in tandem with your live coding mini-language.

With this comes the ability to import fully fledged machine learning libraries such as [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) and [LALOLib](https://mlweb.loria.fr/lalolab/lalolib.html).
