  - **My projects**, is where projects created by you are displayed.
  
  - **All projects**, the projects of all sema users with visibility set to public are displayed here.
  
  - **Examples**, a select few projects that we have chosen to highlight.

The project browser window works much in the same way as a normal file manager in popular operating systems (windows, mac, linux). Its features are listed below.

- If you click the name of a project, it will load it up in your playground.

- You can sort projects by each header by clicking on them. By default, projects are sorted by the most recently updated project is displayed at the top.

- You can toggle the visibility of a project if you are its author by clicking icon under the visibility header. The globe indicates the project is public, and the closed lock indicates it is private.

- Author displays the username of who made the project.

- Updated indicated when the project was last updated.

- If you hover over the options icon you can fork, share or delete a project (if you are its author).

If there are many projects under the chosen viewing category (eg if you are browsing 'All projects'), they will be split over multiple pages. Use the next and previous buttons at the bottom of the project browser to navigate through pages.

## Save status
If you are logged in and you have permission to edit a project (you are the author) all changes are saved automatically. Changes are saved periodically, or upon events such as navigating to a different page. The current save status is indicated to the right of the project browser.

Possible save states
- <ins>Unsaved changes</ins>: there have been edits made to the project. These will be automatically saved.
