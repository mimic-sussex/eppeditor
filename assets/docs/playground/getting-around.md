# Navigation

At the top of the screen, you have a set of links which enable you to navigate within Sema.

**Playground** – This is the main area of sema where you can make your own projects using any of the features of live coding, language creation and machine learning.

**Tutorial** – The tutorial is a structured guide to learning about all areas of sema. If you are new and want to learn step by step this is a good place to start. If you wish, you can also jump to the section you are most interested in. The tutorial has sections on:
- [Basics](/tutorial/01-basics/01-introduction/)
    
- [Live coding with the default language](/tutorial/02-live-coding/01-introduction/)
    
- [Machine Learning](/tutorial/03-machine-learning/01-introduction/)

- [Language Design](/tutorial/04-language-design/01-introduction/)

If you prefer video based tutorials we have a [tutorial playlists on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMJVYzJaZBNnKP6f0le7Lxg/playlists), albeit with a slightly older version of sema.

**Documentation** - This is where you are now. It contains documentation for all areas of sema, broken down into the main areas of sema.

**About** - about page, get to know more about the project.

**Admin** - Only visible if you are logged in and will appear with your username. Here you can edit your profile and manage your projects.

**Login/Signout** - Takes you to the login page, or signs you out of your account.


# Dashboard
Within the playground, the area where widgets such as the live code editor appear is called the dashboard. Here you can arrange widgets however you wish.

All widgets share a few common interactions denoted by the following icons:

    + – top-left corner, drags and positions the widget in a grid layout

    x – top-right corner, removes the widget from the dashboard

    ⨼ – bottom-right corner, resizes the widget

# Sidebar
To the left hand side of the screen in the playground is the sidebar. It is broken down into two sections as indicated by the headers. The 'Widgets' section lets you spawn widgets into the dashboard area such as the live code editor. Below this section, 'Widget Settings', lets you adjust the settings of the currently selected widget.
